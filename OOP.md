**Javascript OOP**

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that supports various programming paradigms such as functional and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is a powerful concept that allows you to structure your code in a way that mirrors real-world objects and their interactions.

**OOP CONCEPTS**
`OBJECTS:` In JavaScript, everything is an object. Objects are containers for properties (variables) and methods (functions). You can create objects using object literals or constructors.

`CLASSES:` ES6 introduced the class syntax in 2015, allowing you to create blueprint-like structures for objects. Classes define how objects should be constructed and what methods and properties they should have.

`INHERITANCE:` Inheritance is a core OOP concept that allows you to create new objects based on existing objects. JavaScript supports prototype-based inheritance, where objects inherit properties and methods from their prototypes.

`ENCAPSULATION:` Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (properties) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (an object). It helps hide the complexity and protect data from unintended changes.

`POLYMOROHISM:` Polymorphism allows different objects to respond to the same method or property in a way that is context-specific. This promotes code flexibility and reuse.


**Benefits of OOP in JavaScript**

`MODULARITY:` OOP allows you to break your code into smaller, self-contained objects, making it easier to manage and maintain.

`REUSABILITY:` Objects and classes can be reused in different parts of your code or in other projects, saving development time.

`READABILITY:` OOP promotes a clear and intuitive structure, making the code more understandable for developers.

`SIMPLIFIED DEBUGGING:` When errors occur, OOP can make it easier to pinpoint the source of the problem, reducing debugging time.
