API stands for Application Programming Interface. In simple terms, it's a set of rules 
that allows one software application to interact with another. They are commonly used to 
fetch or send data from/to a server.

**HTTP methods** are fundamental for interacting with APIs in JavaScript.

**GET Method**: Retrieving Data

The `GET` method is used to request data from a specified resource. It is the default method 
used by browsers when you click a link or enter a URL in the address bar.

**POST Method**: Sending Data
The `POST` method is used to send data to a server to create a new resource. 
It's commonly used when submitting forms or uploading files.

**PUT**
The `PUT` method is used to update a resource or create a new resource if it does not exist like 
updating the details of an existing user account.

**DELETE**
The `DELETE` method is used to request the removal of a resource like deleting a specific user account.
