### Day 1
- I dived deep into the  history of Javascript understanding the origin and founders of Javascript. 
  The rich history of Javascript starting out from *Dec 4th 1995* till now is amazing.
  Kudos to the founding members from Netscape and Brendan Eich for their amazing work!

- Creted a new account on daily.dev and read more Javascript resouces. I learnt a lot of useful skills from there today:
1. Adding a devCard to my github profile.
2. Setup auto-update ðŸš€ for number of articles I will read daily from [daily.dev](https://daily.dev/) to my github account using Github Actions.

- Created a new repo for the AJ90JS Challenge!
1. I will document my progress for each section on a dedicated branch.

- Learn README file markdowns from Ajay Yadav to write this content now as I will be using it to document my journey.
