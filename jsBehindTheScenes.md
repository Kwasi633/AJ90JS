Day 3 and 4 Complete! ðŸš€
How does Javascript work behind the scenes? 
- Got to learn so much about how Javascript code is rendered on the web browser.
- Learnt about the heap, callstack, evenmt loop, callback queue and other concepts.
- Javascript is very dynamic because it can be procedural, OOP and a functional programming language!
- Optimizing and understanding how Javascript works will enable developers to write efficient, 
clean and maintainable code.
- Read my daily resources on Javascript and software engineering from *daily.dev*
