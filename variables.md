Day 6 and 7 Complete! ðŸš€
New section section
- I created a new branch on my AJ90JS repo for the 2nd section of the challenge.

Variables
- They are names that act as a container and are used to store different types of value such as numbers, strings, boolean, arrays, objects, etc.
- Javascript variables are declared using the var, let or const. 
- Variable names can include letters, numbers, $ and underscore but can't 
start with a number.
- They are case sensitive and the best way to declare variables is using
the camelCase syntax.

Let, var and const
- var was the only initial way of declaring variables in Javscript form 1995 - 2015.
- let and const were introduced in 2015.
- var should be used when code must support older browsers, let is used to declare
variables that we want to change the value later whiles const are used to declare
variables that we dont want to change the value forever.
