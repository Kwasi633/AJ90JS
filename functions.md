**Functions**
A function is a piece of code that we can reuse and over again in our code. Functions are a blocks of code that can be executed multiple times, with different inputs to perform a specific task.

**TYPES OF FUNCTIONS**
- Regular functions
- Arrow functions
- Callback Functions
- Async functions
- Immediately Invoked Function Expression
- Anonymous Functions


**Regular Function**

A **regular function** is written by declaring the `function` keyword followed by a `function name`. `()` comes after the function name followed by `{}`

**Calling the function** 

To use a function we call the `function name` followed by `()`

Anytime we call the function, the code inside the function block will be executed.

**Parameters and Arguments**

- Parameters are variables that are initially undefined and dont hold any value. They are defined when the function is called and will hold the value placed inside of the function. A function can take multiple parameters.

- Argument are the real value that are passed to parameters during a function call.

return

In JavaScript, the **`return`** statement is used inside a function to specify the value that the function should produce as its result.

**ARROW FUNCTIONS**

They are a new way of writing javascript functions intoduced in Javascript ES6. An arrow function is a function exprression that is shorter and easier to write. Arrow functions can be stored in a variable to be used later in the code.

They are essential for one-liner functions when there is only one parameter involved and therefore the return keyword is not needed.

Arrow functions with multiple statements require curly  { } braces and a return statement.

Arrow functions can be used to define anonymous fuunctions which can be called immediately after declaration.(IIFE)

**CALLBACK FUNCTIONS**

This is when functions call other functions
