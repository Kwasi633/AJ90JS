**Functions**
A function is a piece of code that we can reuse and over again in our code. Functions are a blocks of code that can be executed multiple times, with different inputs to perform a specific task.

**TYPES OF FUNCTIONS**
- Regular functions
- Arrow functions
- Callback Functions
- Async functions
- Immediately Invoked Function Expression
- Anonymous Functions


**Regular Function**

A **regular function** is written by declaring the `function` keyword followed by a `function name`. `()` comes after the function name followed by `{}`



This provides a shorthand way of writing  **`if-else`** statements. The ternary operator takes three arguments and returns a value based on a condition.

****
__switch__

The switch statement evaluates an expression and compares it to multiple values. It executes a block of code when it gets a strictly matched value. It is often used as an alternative to a series of if/else statements, especially when there are many conditions to check.
