**Arrays**

Arrays enable us to store multiple values under a single variable name. In JavaScript, an array is a data structure that can store multiple values in a single variable. Arrays are used to store lists of values, such as numbers, strings, or objects. Each value in an array is called an element and can be accessed by its index, which is a positive integer that represents its position in the array.


**SYNTAX OF ARRAYS**
```javascript
const arrayName = [ 'element1', 'element2', 'element3']
```
Arrays are 0 based index. This means counting starts from 0. Index refers to the postion of elements in an array. 

```
element1 - 0
element1 - 1
element1 - 2
```

**Array Methods**

`length:` This is used to count the number of elements in an array

`pop()`: This is used to delete the *last element* in the array and returns it.

`push():` This is used to add an element to the *end* of an array

`shift():` This is used to delete the *first element* inside an array.

`unshift():` This adds an element to the *begining* of the array.


**forEach**

This method performs a function for each element in the array. `forEach()` takes a callback funtion which will contain each element from the array as a parameter.

**filter**


The filter method creates a new array by using a filtering function(condition) to keep only elements that satisfy the condition.

**map**

The map method is used to loop through an array and modify its elements. It takes a callback function as an argument and uses the instructions from the callback function to modify the elements inside the array.

**reduce**

It is used to reduce the elements inside an array to a single value. It uses the instruction provided by the callback function to loop through the array and performs an operation on each element.

**find**

The JavascriptÂ find()Â method is used to get the value of the `first element` in the array that satisfies the provided condition. It checks all the elements of the array and whichever the `first element` satisfies the condition is going to print.
