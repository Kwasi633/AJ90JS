**Control Flow Structures**

In JavaScript, the control flow structures are used to control the execution flow of the program based on certain conditions. Conditional statements help us to take decisions with our code.
****
**If**

The if statement evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true. It can be extended with else if and else clauses to handle additional conditions.

****
*if_else* conditions always return a boolean value: true or false

****
**if/else** 

The if/else statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false. 
****
**Tenary Operator**

This provides a shorthand way of writing  **`if-else`** statements. The ternary operator takes three arguments and returns a value based on a condition.

****
__switch__

The switch statement evaluates an expression and compares it to multiple values. It executes a block of code when it gets a strictly matched value. It is often used as an alternative to a series of if/else statements, especially when there are many conditions to check.
